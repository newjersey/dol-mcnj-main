# Security Audit Implementation

This document outlines the comprehensive security audit system implemented for the My Career NJ application.

## Overview

A multi-layered security audit system has been implemented to proactively identify and address security vulnerabilities in both frontend and backend dependencies.

## Components

### 1. NPM Scripts (package.json)

**Frontend Scripts:**
- `npm run security:audit` - Runs audit for moderate+ vulnerabilities
- `npm run security:audit:fix` - Automatically fixes fixable vulnerabilities
- `npm run security:outdated` - Lists outdated packages
- `npm run security:check-all` - Comprehensive security check (frontend + backend)

**Backend Scripts:**
- `npm --prefix=backend run security:audit` - Backend vulnerability audit
- `npm --prefix=backend run security:audit:fix` - Backend auto-fix
- `npm --prefix=backend run security:outdated` - Backend outdated packages
- `npm --prefix=backend run security:licenses` - Backend license summary

### 2. Local Security Script

**Location:** `scripts/security-audit.sh`

**Features:**
- Comprehensive security audit for both frontend and backend
- Colored terminal output for better readability
- Detailed report generation with timestamps
- JSON parsing for detailed vulnerability analysis
- Fails on high/critical vulnerabilities
- Saves reports to `reports/` directory

**Usage:**
```bash
./scripts/security-audit.sh
```

### 3. GitHub Actions Integration

**Security Workflow:**
- Comprehensive vulnerability scanning
- Outdated package detection
- License checking
- Fails CI on high/critical vulnerabilities
- Structured logging for better debugging
- Runs weekly on schedule and on every push/PR

**Location:** `.github/workflows/security.yml`

### 4. Additional Security Workflows

**Location:** `.github/workflows/security-audit.yml`

**Features:**
- Runs on push to main, PRs, and weekly schedule
- Separate dependency review for PRs
- Artifact storage for audit results
- Configurable severity thresholds
- License allowlist checking

**Triggers:**
- Push to main branch
- Pull requests to main
- Weekly schedule (Mondays at 9 AM UTC)
- Manual dispatch

### 5. Integration with Test Suite

**Enhanced test-all.sh:**
- Security audit now runs before tests
- Prevents deployment of vulnerable code
- Integrated into development workflow

## Security Levels

### Vulnerability Levels Monitored:
- **Info:** Tracked but doesn't fail builds
- **Low:** Tracked but doesn't fail builds
- **Moderate:** Reported in audits, warnings generated
- **High:** Fails CI/CD pipeline
- **Critical:** Fails CI/CD pipeline immediately

### License Management:
- Approved licenses: MIT, Apache-2.0, BSD-3-Clause, BSD-2-Clause, ISC, 0BSD
- Dependency review blocks PRs with unapproved licenses

## Usage Guide

### Daily Development:
```bash
# Quick security check
npm run security:audit

# Comprehensive check
npm run security:check-all

# Local detailed audit
./scripts/security-audit.sh
```

### CI/CD Integration:
- Automatically runs on all builds
- Reports stored as artifacts
- Fails builds on high/critical vulnerabilities

### Weekly Maintenance:
- Automated GitHub Actions runs weekly
- Review security reports in Actions tab
- Update dependencies as needed

## File Structure

```
├── .github/workflows/
│   ├── security.yml                # GitHub Actions security workflow
│   └── ci.yml                      # Main CI orchestrator (includes security)
├── scripts/
│   ├── security-audit.sh           # Local security audit script
│   └── test-all.sh                 # Enhanced with security checks
├── reports/                        # Generated security reports (gitignored)
├── package.json                    # Frontend security scripts
└── backend/package.json            # Backend security scripts
```

## Benefits

1. **Proactive Security:** Catches vulnerabilities before deployment
2. **Comprehensive Coverage:** Both frontend and backend dependencies
3. **Multi-Environment:** Local development, CI/CD, and scheduled checks
4. **Detailed Reporting:** Structured reports with actionable insights
5. **Automated Remediation:** Auto-fix capabilities where safe
6. **License Compliance:** Ensures only approved licenses are used
7. **Developer Experience:** Easy-to-use commands integrated into workflow

## Maintenance

### Regular Tasks:
1. Review weekly security reports
2. Update dependencies with `npm audit fix`
3. Manually update packages that can't be auto-fixed
4. Review and update license allowlist as needed
5. Monitor CI/CD for security failures

### When Security Issues Are Found:
1. Assess severity and impact
2. Apply fixes using `npm audit fix` or manual updates
3. Test thoroughly after updates
4. Document any exceptions or workarounds needed

This security audit system provides comprehensive protection while maintaining developer productivity and ensuring compliance with security best practices.
