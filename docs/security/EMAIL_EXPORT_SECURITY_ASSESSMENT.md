# Secure Email Export Solution

## Overview

Lambda-based solution for delivering encrypted subscriber data to non-technical analysts via email. Implements multiple security layers to minimize exposure while maintaining usability.

## Security Assessment

### ✅ Security Strengths

- **Multi-Layer Encryption**: DynamoDB (KMS) → ZIP (AES-256) → S3 encryption → TLS transport
- **Time-Limited Access**: 24-hour download expiration with automatic S3 cleanup
- **Complete Audit Trail**: Operation tracking, failed attempts, security notifications
- **Data Minimization**: Configurable limits, date filtering, no persistent storage

### ⚠️ Residual Risks

- **Email Storage**: Files persist in email systems until manually deleted
- **Password Transmission**: Same email contains password and download link
- **Device Security**: Analyst devices may not meet enterprise security standards
- **Human Factors**: Risk of password sharing, forwarding, or protocol violations

## Security Mitigations

### Required Controls
- **Corporate email only** (no Gmail, Yahoo, etc.)
- **Device security standards**: Encrypted drives, endpoint protection, MDM
- **Security training**: Data handling protocols and incident reporting
- **Enhanced monitoring**: Real-time alerts, geolocation verification

### Alternative Delivery Options
1. **Separate password delivery** via SMS or secure channel
2. **CLI tool only** for maximum security (no email transmission)
3. **Enhanced monitoring** with real-time alerts and geolocation verification

## Implementation Decision

### ✅ Proceed with email solution IF:
- Corporate email infrastructure with retention policies
- Analyst device security standards enforced
- Security team monitoring capacity available
- Temporary solution (6-12 months) while planning upgrade

### ❌ Consider alternatives IF:
- Extremely high data sensitivity or compliance restrictions
- Limited control over analyst devices/email systems
- Long-term solution needed
- Email transmission prohibited by regulations

## Required Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
DDB_TABLE_NAME=your-subscribers-table
FROM_EMAIL=no-reply@dol.nj.gov
ANALYST_EMAILS=analyst1@dol.nj.gov,analyst2@dol.nj.gov
CC_SECURITY_EMAIL=security@dol.nj.gov
EXPORT_S3_BUCKET=your-secure-export-bucket
EXPORT_SCHEDULE=weekly
```

### AWS Services
- Lambda (export processing)
- S3 (temporary storage with lifecycle policies)
- SES (email delivery)
- CloudWatch (monitoring)
- IAM (access controls)

## Security Checklist

### Pre-Deployment
- [ ] Corporate email accounts configured
- [ ] S3 bucket secured with lifecycle policies  
- [ ] Analyst device security requirements documented
- [ ] Security team monitoring configured

### Post-Deployment
- [ ] Email encryption enabled (S/MIME)
- [ ] Incident response procedures defined
- [ ] Security awareness training completed
- [ ] Regular security reviews scheduled

## Conclusion

**Recommended approach**: The Lambda email solution provides reasonable security for non-technical analysts when properly implemented with corporate email infrastructure and device security standards.

**Key success factors**:
- Strict security protocol adherence
- Regular monitoring and auditing  
- Ongoing security training
- Migration plan to more secure long-term solution

This solution is appropriate for organizations with good security governance but should be avoided if email systems lack proper security controls or regulatory requirements prohibit email transmission of sensitive data.
