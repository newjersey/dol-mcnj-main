Hi Josefine.
I was under the impression that we had discontinued offering our services through Workforce. If that has not happened, we would like it to!
The company name is Noble Desktop, LLC. The last student we had from Workforce was from September of 2006 I believe, and I know I had sent in accompanying paper work for her as we did receive most of our payment.


Please let me know what information I can provide you with in order to take our name off of your services.
Thanks,
Megan

We also do not have any record of admissions that would indicate a rationale to remain on the list.

Hello Ms. Dara L. Barry,

Thank you for the information.
100% of my students are private paying and I do not intend to enroll any federal and/or state workforce funded students.

I am opting not to list my school on the NJTOPPS.com site.

You have been a great help!!!

Sincerely,
