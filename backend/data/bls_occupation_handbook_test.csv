				",text,Accountants and auditors prepare and examine financial records.,html,"

<p>Most accountants and auditors need at least a bachelor&rsquo;s degree in accounting or a related field. Certification, including the Certified Public Accountant (CPA) credential, can improve job prospects. &nbsp;</p>
<h3>Education</h3>
<p>Most accountant and auditor positions require at least a bachelor&rsquo;s degree in accounting or a related field. Some employers prefer to hire applicants who have a master&rsquo;s degree, either in accounting or in business administration with a concentration in accounting.</p>
<p>A few universities and colleges offer specialized programs, such as a bachelor&rsquo;s degree in internal auditing. In some cases, those with associate&rsquo;s degrees, as well as bookkeepers and accounting clerks who meet the education and experience requirements set by their employers, get junior accounting positions and advance to accountant positions by showing their accounting skills on the job.</p>
<p>Many colleges help students gain practical experience through summer or part-time internships with public accounting or business firms.</p>
<h3>Licenses, Certifications, and Registrations</h3>
<p>Every accountant filing a report with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is required by law to be a Certified Public Accountant (CPA). Many other accountants choose to become a CPA to enhance their job prospects or to gain clients. Many employers will pay the costs associated with the CPA exam.</p>
<p>CPAs are licensed by their state&rsquo;s Board of Accountancy. Becoming a CPA requires passing a national exam and meeting other state requirements. Almost all states require CPA candidates to complete 150 semester hours of college coursework to be licensed, which is 30 hours more than the usual 4-year bachelor&rsquo;s degree. Many schools offer a 5-year combined bachelor&rsquo;s and master&rsquo;s degree to meet the 150-hour requirement, but a master&rsquo;s degree is not required.</p>
<p>A few states allow a number of years of public accounting experience to substitute for a college degree.</p>
<p>All states use the four-part Uniform CPA Examination from the <a class=""external"" href=""http://www.aicpa.org/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA)</a>. Candidates do not have to pass all four parts at once, but most states require that candidates pass all four parts within 18 months of passing their first part.</p>
<p>Almost all states require CPAs to take continuing education to keep their license.</p>
<p>Certification provides an advantage in the job market because it shows professional competence in a specialized field of accounting and auditing. Accountants and auditors seek certifications from a variety of professional societies. Some of the most common certifications are listed below:</p>
<p>The <a class=""external"" href=""https://www.imanet.org/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Institute of Management Accountants</a> offers the Certified Management Accountant (CMA) to applicants who complete a bachelor&rsquo;s degree. Applicants must have worked at least 2 years in management accounting, pass a two-part exam, agree to meet continuing education requirements, and comply with standards of professional conduct. The exam covers areas such as financial statement analysis, working-capital policy, capital structure, valuation issues, and risk management.</p>
<p><a class=""external"" href=""https://na.theiia.org/Pages/IIAHome.aspx"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">The Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA)</a> offers the Certified Internal Auditor (CIA) to graduates from accredited colleges and universities who have worked for 2 years as internal auditors and have passed a four-part exam. The IIA also offers the Certified in Control Self-Assessment (CCSA), Certified Government Auditing Professional (CGAP), Certified Financial Services Auditor (CFSA), and Certification in Risk Management Assurance (CRMA) to those who pass the exams and meet educational and experience requirements.</p>
<p><a class=""external"" href=""https://www.isaca.org/pages/default.aspx"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">ISACA</a> offers the Certified Information Systems Auditor (CISA) to candidates who pass an exam and have 5 years of experience auditing information systems. Information systems experience, financial or operational auditing experience, or related college credit hours can be substituted for up to 3 years of experience in information systems auditing, control, or security.</p>
<p>For accountants with a CPA, the AICPA offers the option to receive any or all of the Accredited in Business Valuation (ABV), Certified Information Technology Professional (CITP), or Personal Financial Specialist (PFS) certifications. The ABV requires passing a written exam, completion of at least six business valuation projects, and 75 hours of continuing education. The CITP requires 1,000 hours of business technology experience and 75 hours of continuing education. Candidates for the PFS also must complete a certain amount of work experience and continuing education, and pass a written exam.</p>
<h3>Advancement</h3>
<p>Some <a href=""/ooh/management/top-executives.htm"" title=""Top Executives""><u>top executives</u></a> and <a href=""/ooh/management/financial-managers.htm"" title=""Financial Managers""><u>financial managers</u></a> have a background in accounting, internal auditing, or finance.</p>
<p>Entry-level public accountants can advance to senior positions with more responsibility. Those who excel may become supervisors, managers, or partners; open their own public accounting firm; or transfer to executive positions in management accounting or internal auditing in private firms.</p>
<p>Management accountants often start as cost accountants, junior internal auditors, or trainees for other accounting positions. As they rise through the organization, they may advance to accounting manager, chief cost accountant, budget director, or manager of internal auditing. Some become controllers, treasurers, financial vice presidents, chief financial officers, or corporation presidents.</p>
<p>Public accountants, management accountants, and internal auditors can move from one aspect of accounting and auditing to another. Public accountants often move into management accounting or internal auditing. Management accountants may become internal auditors, and internal auditors may become management accountants. However, it is less common for management accountants or internal auditors to move into public accounting.</p>
<h3>Important Qualities</h3>
<p><strong><em>Analytical skills.</em></strong> Accountants and auditors must be able to identify issues in documentation and suggest solutions. For example, public accountants use analytical skills in their work to minimize tax liability, and internal auditors use these skills to detect fraudulent use of funds.</p>
<p><strong><em>Communication skills.</em></strong> Accountants and auditors must be able to listen carefully to facts and concerns from clients, managers, and others. They must also be able to discuss the results of their work in both meetings and written reports.</p>
<p><strong><em>Detail oriented.</em></strong> Accountants and auditors must pay attention to detail when compiling and examining documentation.</p>
<p><strong><em>Math skills.</em></strong> Accountants and auditors must be able to analyze, compare, and interpret facts and figures, although complex math skills are not necessary.</p>
<p><strong><em>Organizational skills.</em></strong> Strong organizational skills are important for accountants and auditors, who often work with a range of financial documents for a variety of clients.</p>

  ",html,"

<p>Employment of accountants and auditors is projected to grow&nbsp;4 percent from 2019 to 2029, about as fast as&nbsp;the average for all occupations. Globalization, a growing economy, and a complex tax and regulatory environment are expected to continue to lead to strong demand for accountants and auditors.</p>
<p>In general, employment growth of accountants and auditors is expected to be closely tied to the health of the overall economy. As the economy grows, these workers will continue to be needed to prepare and examine financial records. In addition, as more companies go public, there will be greater need for public accountants to handle the legally required financial documentation.</p>
<p>The continued globalization of business may lead to increased demand for accounting expertise and services related to international trade and international mergers and acquisitions.</p>
<p>Technological change is expected to affect the role of accountants over the next 10 years. As platforms such as cloud computing become more widespread, some routine accounting tasks may become automated. Although this will allow accountants to become more efficient, this change is not expected to reduce the overall demand for accountants. Instead, with the automation of routine tasks, such as data entry, the advisory and analytical duties of accountants will become more prominent.</p>
<h3>Job Prospects</h3>
<p>Demand for accountants may lead to good prospects for entry-level positions. However, competition will be stronger for jobs with the most prestigious accounting and business firms.</p>
<p>Accountants and auditors who have earned professional recognition, especially as Certified Public Accountants (CPAs), should have the best prospects. Job applicants who have a master&rsquo;s degree in accounting or a master&rsquo;s degree in business administration (MBA) with a concentration in accounting also may have an advantage.</p>

    		<h4>Work Environment</h4>

<p>Most accountants and auditors work full time. Some work more than 40 hours per week. Overtime hours are typical at certain times of the year, such as at the end of the budget year or during tax season.</p>
		",text,Accountants and Auditors,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9pgua9hT6k,html,"

<p>Accountants and auditors prepare and examine financial records. They ensure that financial records are accurate and that taxes are paid properly and on time. Accountants and auditors assess financial operations and work to help ensure that organizations run efficiently.</p>
<h3>Duties</h3>
<p>Accountants and auditors typically do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Examine financial statements to ensure that they are accurate and comply with laws and regulations</li>
<li>Compute taxes owed, prepare tax returns, and ensure that taxes are paid properly and on time</li>
<li>Inspect account books and accounting systems for efficiency and use of accepted accounting procedures</li>
<li>Organize and maintain financial records</li>
<li>Assess financial operations and make best-practices recommendations to management</li>
<li>Suggest ways to reduce costs, enhance revenues, and improve profits</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to examining and preparing financial documentation, accountants and auditors must explain their findings. This includes preparing written reports and meeting face-to-face with organization managers and individual clients.</p>
<p>Many accountants and auditors specialize, depending on the particular organization that they work for. Some work for organizations that specialize in assurance services (improving the quality or context of information for decisionmakers) or risk management (determining the probability of a misstatement on financial documentation). Other organizations specialize in specific industries, such as healthcare.</p>
<p>The following are examples of types of accountants and auditors:</p>
<p><strong><em>Public accountants</em></strong> perform a broad range of accounting, auditing, tax, and consulting tasks. Their clients include corporations, governments, and individuals.</p>
<p>Public accountants work with financial documents that clients are required by law to disclose. These include tax forms and balance sheet statements that corporations must provide to potential investors. For example, some public accountants concentrate on tax matters, advising corporations about the tax advantages of certain business decisions or preparing individual income tax returns.</p>
<p>Public accountants, many of whom are Certified Public Accountants (CPAs), generally have their own businesses or work for public accounting firms. Publicly traded companies are required to have CPAs sign documents they submit to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including annual and quarterly reports.</p>
<p>Some public accountants specialize in forensic accounting, investigating financial crimes such as securities fraud and embezzlement, bankruptcies and contract disputes, and other complex and potentially criminal financial transactions. Forensic accountants combine their knowledge of accounting and finance with law and investigative techniques to determine if an activity is illegal. Many forensic accountants work closely with law enforcement personnel and lawyers during investigations and often appear as expert witnesses during trials.</p>
<p><strong><em>Management accountants</em></strong>, also called <em>cost</em>,<strong><em> </em></strong><em>managerial</em>,<strong><em> </em></strong><em>industrial</em>, <em>corporate</em>, or <em>private accountants</em>, record and analyze the financial information of the organizations for which they work. The information that management accountants prepare is intended for internal use by business managers, not by the general public.</p>
<p>Management accountants often work on budgeting and performance evaluation. They also may help organizations plan the cost of doing business. Some may work with financial managers on asset management, which involves planning and selecting financial investments such as stocks, bonds, and real estate.</p>
<p><strong><em>Government accountants</em></strong> maintain and examine the records of government agencies and audit private businesses and individuals whose activities are subject to government regulations or taxation. Accountants employed by federal, state, and local governments ensure that revenues are received and spent in accordance with laws and regulations.</p>
<p><strong><em>Internal auditors</em></strong> check for mismanagement of an organization&rsquo;s funds. They identify ways to improve the processes for finding and eliminating waste and fraud. The practice of internal auditing is not regulated, but The Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA) provides generally accepted standards.</p>
<p><strong><em>External auditors</em></strong><em> </em>perform similar duties to internal auditors, but are employed by an outside organization, rather than the one they are auditing. They review clients&rsquo; financial statements and inform investors and authorities that the statements have been correctly prepared and reported.</p>
<p><strong><em>Information technology auditors</em></strong> are internal auditors who review controls for their organization&rsquo;s computer systems to ensure that the financial data comes from a reliable source.</p>

				",text,"Actors express ideas and portray characters in theater, film, television, and other performing arts media.",html,"

<p>Many actors enhance their skills through formal dramatic education, and long-term training is common.</p>
<h3>Education</h3>
<p>Many actors enhance their skills through formal dramatic education. Many who specialize in theater have bachelor&rsquo;s degrees, but a degree is not required.</p>
<p>Although some people succeed in acting without getting a formal education, most actors acquire some formal preparation through a theater company&rsquo;s acting conservatory or a university drama or theater arts program. Students can take college classes in drama or filmmaking to prepare for a career as an actor. Classes in dance or music may help as well.</p>
<p>Actors who do not have a college degree may take acting or film classes to learn their craft. Community colleges, acting conservatories, and private film schools typically offer these classes. Many theater companies also have education programs.</p>
<h3>Important Qualities</h3>
<p><strong><em>Creativity.</em></strong> Actors interpret their characters&rsquo; feelings and motives in order to portray the characters in the most compelling way.</p>
<p><strong><em>Memorization skills.</em></strong> Actors memorize many lines before filming begins or a show opens. Television actors often appear on camera with little time to memorize scripts, and scripts frequently may be revised or even written just moments before filming.</p>
<p><strong><em>Persistence.</em></strong> Actors may audition for many roles before getting a job. They must be able to accept rejection and keep going.</p>
<p><strong><em>Physical stamina.</em></strong> Actors should be in good enough physical condition to endure the heat from stage or studio lights and the weight of heavy costumes or makeup. They may work many hours, including acting in more than one performance a day, and they must do so without getting overly tired.</p>
<p><strong><em>Reading skills.</em></strong> Actors must read scripts and be able to interpret how a writer has developed their character.</p>
<p><strong><em>Speaking skills.</em></strong> Actors&mdash;particularly stage actors&mdash;must say their lines clearly, project their voice, and pronounce words so that audiences understand them.</p>
<p>In addition to these qualities, actors usually must be physically coordinated to perform predetermined, sometimes complex movements with other actors, such as dancing or stage fighting, in order to complete a scene.</p>
<h3>Training</h3>
<p>It takes many years of practice to develop the skills needed to be a successful actor, and actors never truly finish training. They work to improve their acting skills throughout their career. Many actors continue to train through workshops, rehearsals, or mentoring by a drama coach.</p>
<p>Every role is different, and an actor may need to learn something new for each one. For example, a role may require learning how to sing or dance, or an actor may have to learn to speak with an accent or to play a musical instrument or sport.</p>
<p>Many aspiring actors begin by participating in school plays or local theater productions. In television and film, actors usually start out in smaller roles or independent movies and work their way up to bigger productions.</p>
<h3>Advancement</h3>
<p>As an actor&rsquo;s reputation grows, he or she may work on bigger projects or in more prestigious venues. Some actors become <a href=""/ooh/entertainment-and-sports/producers-and-directors.htm"" title=""Producers and Directors"">producers and directors</a>.</p>

  ",html,"

<p>Employment of actors is projected to&nbsp;grow 3 percent&nbsp;from 2019 to 2029, about as fast as the average for all occupations. The number of Internet-only platforms, such as streaming services, is likely to increase, along with the number of shows produced for these platforms. This growth may lead to more work for actors.</p>
<p>Many small and medium-sized theaters have difficulty getting funding. As a result, the number of performances is expected to decline. Large theaters, with their more stable sources of funding and more well-known plays and musicals, should provide more opportunities for actors.</p>
<h3>Job Prospects</h3>
<p>Actors face intense competition for jobs. Most roles, no matter how minor, have many actors auditioning for them. For stage roles, actors with a bachelor&rsquo;s degree in theater may have a better chance of landing a part than those without one.</p>

<p>Actors express ideas and portray characters in theater, film, television, and other performing arts media. They interpret a writer&rsquo;s script to entertain or inform an audience.</p>
<h3>Duties</h3>
<p>Actors typically do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Read scripts and meet with agents and other professionals before accepting a role</li>
<li>Audition in front of directors, producers, and casting directors</li>
<li>Research their character&rsquo;s personal traits and circumstances to portray the characters more authentically to an audience</li>
<li>Memorize their lines</li>
<li>Rehearse their lines and performance, including on stage or in front of the camera, with other actors</li>
<li>Discuss their role with the director, producer, and other actors to improve the overall performance of the show</li>
<li>Perform the role, following the director&rsquo;s directions</li>
</ul>
<p>Most actors struggle to find steady work, and few achieve recognition as stars. Some work as &ldquo;extras&rdquo;&mdash;actors who have no lines to deliver but are included in scenes to give a more realistic setting. Some actors do voiceover or narration work for animated features, audiobooks, or other electronic media.</p>
<p>In some stage or film productions, actors sing, dance, or play a musical instrument. For some roles, an actor must learn a new skill, such as horseback riding or stage fighting.</p>
<p>Most actors have long periods of unemployment between roles and often hold other jobs in order to make a living. Some actors teach acting classes as a second job.</p>

<p>Work assignments are usually short, ranging from 1 day to a few months, and actors often hold another job in order to make a living. They are frequently under the stress of having to find their next job. Some actors in touring companies may be employed for several years.</p>
<p>Actors may perform in unpleasant conditions, such as outdoors in bad weather, under hot stage lights, or while wearing an uncomfortable costume or makeup.</p>
<h3>Work Schedules</h3>
<p>Work hours for actors are extensive and irregular. Early morning, evening, weekend, and holiday work is common.&nbsp;Some actors work part time. Few actors work full time, and many have variable schedules. Those who work in theater may travel with a touring show across the country. Film and television actors may also travel to work on location.</p>

				",text,"Actuaries use mathematics, statistics, and financial theory to analyze the financial costs of risk and uncertainty.",html,"

<p>Actuaries need a bachelor&rsquo;s degree, typically in mathematics, actuarial science, statistics, or some other analytical field. Students must complete coursework in economics, applied statistics, and corporate finance, and must pass a series of exams to become certified professionals.</p>
<h3>Education</h3>
<p>Actuaries must have a strong background in mathematics, statistics, and business. Typically, an actuary has an undergraduate degree in mathematics, actuarial science, statistics, or some other analytical field.</p>
<p>To become certified professionals, students must complete coursework in economics, statistics, and corporate finance.</p>
<p>Students also should take classes outside of mathematics and business to prepare them for a career as an actuary. Coursework in computer science, especially programming languages, and the ability to use and develop spreadsheets, databases, and statistical analysis tools, are valuable. Classes in writing and public speaking will improve students&rsquo; ability to communicate in the business world.</p>
<h3>Licenses, Certification, and Registrations</h3>
<p>Two professional societies&mdash;the <a class=""external"" href=""http://www.casact.org/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Casualty Actuarial Society</a> (CAS) and the <a class=""external"" href=""https://www.soa.org/member/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Society of Actuaries</a> (SOA)&mdash;sponsor programs leading to full professional status. The CAS and SOA offer two levels of certification: associate and fellow.</p>
<p>The CAS certifies actuaries who work in the property and casualty field, which includes automobile, homeowners, medical malpractice, and workers&rsquo; compensation insurance.</p>
<p>The SOA certifies actuaries who work in life insurance, health insurance, retirement benefits, investments, and finance.</p>
<p>Both professional societies require applicants to complete certain educational coursework in economics, finance, and mathematical statistics while in college. Applicants also must pass seven exams for associate-level certification.</p>
<p>Many employers expect students to have passed at least one or two of the initial actuary exams needed for professional certification before graduation.</p>
<p>In addition, both CAS and SOA require that candidates take seminars on professionalism. Both societies have mandatory e-learning courses for candidates.</p>
<p>It typically takes 4 to 7 years for an actuary to earn the associate-level certification, because each exam requires hundreds of hours of study and months of preparation.</p>
<p>After becoming associates, actuaries typically take 2 to 3 more years to earn fellowship status.</p>
<p>The SOA offers fellowship certification in five separate tracks: life and annuities, group and health benefits, retirement benefits, investments, and finance/enterprise risk management. Unlike the SOA, the CAS does not offer specialized study tracks for fellowship certification.</p>
<p>Both the CAS and the SOA have a continuing education requirement. Most actuaries meet this requirement by attending training seminars that are sponsored by their employers or the societies.</p>
<p>Pension actuaries typically must be licensed by the U.S. Department of Labor and U.S. Department of the Treasury&rsquo;s <a class=""external"" href=""http://www.irs.gov/Tax-Professionals/Enrolled-Actuaries"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Joint Board for the Enrollment of Actuaries</a>. Applicants must meet certain experience requirements and pass two exams administered through the SOA to qualify for enrollment.</p>
<h3>Other Experience</h3>
<p>Because there are different types of practice areas, including health, life, pension, and casualty, internships may be helpful for students deciding on which actuarial track to pursue.</p>
<h3>Training</h3>
<p>Most entry-level actuaries start out as trainees. They are typically on teams with more experienced actuaries who serve as mentors. At first, they perform basic tasks, such as compiling data, but as they gain more experience, they may conduct research and write reports. Beginning actuaries may spend time working in other departments, such as marketing, underwriting, and product development, to learn all aspects of the company&rsquo;s work and how actuarial work applies to each one.</p>
<p>Most employers support their actuaries throughout the certification process. For example, employers typically pay the cost of exams and study materials. Many firms provide paid time to study and encourage their employees to set up study groups. Employees usually receive raises or bonuses for each exam that they pass.</p>
<h3>Advancement</h3>
<p>Advancement depends largely on job performance and the number of actuarial exams passed. For example, actuaries who achieve fellowship status often supervise the work of other actuaries and provide advice to senior management. Actuaries with a broad knowledge of risk management and how it applies to business can rise to executive positions in their companies, such as chief risk officer or chief financial officer.</p>
<h3>Important Qualities</h3>
<p><strong><em>Analytical skills.</em></strong> Actuaries use analytical skills to identify patterns and trends in complex sets of data to determine the factors that have an effect on certain types of events.</p>
<p><strong><em>Communication skills.</em></strong> Actuaries must be able to explain complex technical matters to those without an actuarial background. They must also communicate clearly through the reports and memos that describe their work and recommendations.</p>
<p><strong><em>Computer skills.</em></strong> Actuaries must know programming languages and be able to use and develop spreadsheets, databases, and statistical analysis tools.</p>
<p><strong><em>Interpersonal skills.</em></strong> Actuaries serve as leaders and members of teams, so they must be able to listen to other people&rsquo;s opinions and suggestions before reaching a conclusion.</p>
<p><strong><em>Math skills.</em></strong> Actuaries quantify risk by using the principles of calculus, statistics, and probability.</p>
<p><strong><em>Problem-solving skills.</em></strong> Actuaries identify risks and develop ways for businesses to manage those risks.</p>

  ",html,"

<p>Employment of actuaries is projected to grow 18 percent from 2019 to 2029, much faster than the average for all occupations.</p>
<p>Actuaries will be needed to develop, price, and evaluate a variety of insurance products and calculate the costs of new risks.</p>
<p>More actuaries will also be needed to help companies manage their own risk, a practice known as enterprise risk management. Actuaries will help companies avoid, manage, and respond to any potential financial risks across all areas of their business operations. This analysis helps companies adjust their business or investment strategies to achieve economic returns and respond to new financial regulations and requirements.</p>
<p>Insurance companies will need actuaries to analyze the large amount of information, such as medical or property data, collected from consumers. The increase in available data will allow insurance companies to better develop new products, set competitive prices, predict consumer behavior, and make more accurate projections of future risks and costs.</p>
<p>In addition, health insurance companies will require more actuaries to help evaluate the effects of changing healthcare regulations and guidelines, expand into new insurance markets, and offer products to new customers.</p>
<h3>Job Prospects</h3>
<p>Job opportunities should be somewhat competitive for entry-level applicants because the number of students sitting for actuarial exams has increased in the past few years. Students who have passed at least two actuarial exams, have had an internship while in college, and have strong analytical and business skills should have the best job prospects for entry-level positions.</p>

		",html,"
    		<h4>Work Environment</h4>

<p>Most actuaries work for insurance companies. Although most work full time in an office setting, some actuaries who work as consultants may travel to meet with clients.</p>
		",text,Actuaries,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oy6_S6EzOHw,html,"

<p>Actuaries analyze the financial costs of risk and uncertainty. They use mathematics, statistics, and financial theory to assess the risk of potential events, and they help businesses and clients develop policies that minimize the cost of that risk. Actuaries&rsquo; work is essential to the insurance industry.</p>
<h3>Duties</h3>
<p>Actuaries typically do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compile statistical data and other information for further analysis</li>
<li>Estimate the probability and likely economic cost of an event such as death, sickness, an accident, or a natural disaster</li>
<li>Design, test, and administer insurance policies, investments, pension plans, and other business strategies to minimize risk and maximize profitability</li>
<li>Produce charts, tables, and reports that explain calculations and proposals</li>
<li>Explain their findings and proposals to company executives, government officials, shareholders, and clients</li>
</ul>
<p>Most actuarial work is done with computers. Actuaries use database software to compile information. They use advanced statistics and modeling software to forecast the probability of an event occurring, the potential costs of the event if it does occur, and whether the insurance company has enough money to pay future claims.</p>
<p>Actuaries typically work on teams that often include managers and professionals in other fields, such as accounting, underwriting, and finance. For example, some actuaries work with <a href=""/ooh/business-and-financial/accountants-and-auditors.htm"" title=""Accountants and Auditors""><u>accountants</u></a> and <a href=""/ooh/business-and-financial/financial-analysts.htm"" title=""Financial Analysts""><u>financial analysts</u></a> to set the price for security offerings or with <a href=""/ooh/business-and-financial/market-research-analysts.htm"" title=""Market Research Analysts""><u>market research analysts</u></a> to forecast demand for new products.</p>
<p>Most actuaries work at insurance companies, where they help design policies and determine the premiums that should be charged for each policy. They must ensure that the premiums are profitable yet competitive with other insurance companies.</p>
<p>Actuaries in the insurance industry typically specialize in a specific field of insurance, such as one of the following:</p>
<p><strong><em>Health insurance actuaries</em></strong> help develop long-term care and health insurance policies by predicting expected costs of providing care under the terms of an insurance contract. Their predictions are based on numerous factors, including family history, geographic location, and occupation.</p>
<p><strong><em>Life insurance actuaries</em></strong> help develop annuity and life insurance policies for individuals and groups by estimating, on the basis of risk factors such as age, gender, and tobacco use, how long someone is expected to live.</p>
<p><strong><em>Property and casualty insurance actuaries</em></strong> help develop insurance policies that insure policyholders against property loss and liability resulting from accidents, natural disasters, fires, and other events. They calculate the expected number of claims resulting from automobile accidents, which varies with the insured person&rsquo;s age, sex, driving history, type of car, and other factors.</p>
<p>Some actuaries apply their expertise to financial matters outside of the insurance industry. For example, they develop investment strategies that manage risks and maximize returns for companies or individuals.</p>
<p><strong><em>Pension and retirement benefits actuaries</em></strong> design, test, and evaluate company pension plans to determine if the expected funds available in the future will be enough to ensure payment of future benefits. They must report the results of their evaluations to the federal government. Pension actuaries also help businesses develop other types of retirement plans, such as 401(k)s and healthcare plans for retirees. In addition, they provide retirement planning advice to individuals.</p>
<p><strong><em>Enterprise risk actuaries</em></strong> identify any risks, including economic, financial, and geopolitical risks that may affect a company&rsquo;s short-term or long-term objectives. They help top executives determine how much risk the business is willing to take, and they develop strategies to respond to these issues.</p>
<p>Actuaries also work in the public sector. In the federal government, actuaries may evaluate proposed changes to Social Security or Medicare or conduct economic and demographic studies to project future benefit obligations. At the state level, actuaries may examine and regulate the rates charged by insurance companies.</p>
<p>Some actuaries are considered consultants and provide advice to clients on a contract basis. Many consulting actuaries audit the work of internal actuaries at insurance companies or handle actuarial duties for insurance companies that are not large enough to keep their own actuaries on staff.</p>

<p>Although educational requirements for administrative services managers vary by&nbsp;organization and the work they do, they usually must have a bachelor&rsquo;s degree and&nbsp;related work experience.</p>
<h3>Education</h3>
<p>Administrative services managers typically need a bachelor&rsquo;s degree, usually in business or a related field. However, some people enter the occupation with a high school diploma.</p>
<h3>Work Experience</h3>
<p>Administrative services managers must have related work experience that reflects managerial and leadership abilities. Facilities managers should have experience in business operations, project management, and building maintenance, such as from jobs as a <a href=""/ooh/installation-maintenance-and-repair/general-maintenance-and-repair-workers.htm"" title=""General Maintenance and Repair Workers""><u>general maintenance and repair worker</u></a> or a <a href=""/ooh/business-and-financial/cost-estimators.htm"" title=""Cost Estimators""><u>cost estimator</u></a>. Records and information managers should have administrative or business operations experience involving recordkeeping. Records and information managers in the legal field often must have experience as a <a href=""/ooh/legal/paralegals-and-legal-assistants.htm"" title=""Paralegals and Legal Assistants""><u>paralegal or legal assistant</u></a>.</p>
<h3>Licenses, Certifications, and Registrations</h3>
<p>Although it is not required, professional certification may give candidates an advantage when applying for jobs.</p>
<p>Several professional associations for administrative services managers offer certifications. Some associations, including the <a class=""external"" href=""https://www.ifma.org/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">International Facility Management Association</a> (IFMA), offer certification that specializes in facility management. Others offering certification include the <a class=""external"" href=""https://www.icrm.org/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Institute of Certified Records Managers</a> (ICRM), for records and information managers, and the <a class=""external"" href=""http://www.arma.org/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">ARMA International</a> for those specializing in information governance.</p>
<h3>Important Qualities</h3>
<p><strong><em>Analytical skills.</em></strong> Administrative services managers must be able to review an organization&rsquo;s procedures for ways to improve efficiency.</p>
<p><strong><em>Communication skills.</em></strong> Administrative services managers often work with others. They must be able to convey ideas clearly, both orally and in writing.</p>
<p><strong><em>Detail oriented.</em></strong> Administrative services managers must pay attention to details across a range of tasks, such as ensuring that the organization complies with building codes and managing the process of buying equipment.</p>
<p><strong><em>Leadership skills.</em></strong> In directing workers and coordinating organizational duties, administrative services managers must be able to motivate employees and handle problems that arise.</p>

<p>Employment of administrative services managers is projected to grow&nbsp;6 percent from 2019 to 2029, faster than the average for all occupations. Administrative tasks, including facilities management and records and information management, will remain important in a range of industries.</p>
<p>A continuing focus on the environmental impact and energy efficiency of buildings will keep facilities managers in demand. Improving energy efficiency can reduce costs and often is required by regulation. For example, building codes typically ensure that buildings meet environmental standards. Facilities managers will be needed to oversee these improvements in a wide range of areas, from heating and air-conditioning systems to roofing. In addition, facilities managers will be needed to plan for natural disasters, ensuring that any damage to a building will be minimal and that the organization can get back to work quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Smart building&rdquo; technology is expected to affect the work of facilities managers over the next decade. This technology will provide facilities managers with timely and detailed information, such as equipment failure alerts and reminders to&nbsp;do maintenance. This information should allow facilities managers to complete their work more efficiently.</p>
<p>Employment of records and information managers also is expected to grow. Demand is expected to be particularly strong for those working in &ldquo;information governance,&rdquo; which includes the privacy and legal aspects of records management. As cloud computing and mobile devices become more prevalent, records and information managers will have a critical role in helping organizations develop new records and information management practices and in maintaining data security.</p>
<h3>Job Prospects</h3>
<p>About&nbsp;26,300 openings for administrative services managers are projected each year, on average, over the decade.</p>
<p>Many of those openings are expected to result from the need to replace workers who transfer to different occupations or exit the labor force, such as to retire.</p>

<p>Administrative services managers plan, direct, and coordinate activities that help an organization run efficiently. The specific responsibilities vary, but these managers typically maintain facilities and supervise activities that include recordkeeping, mail distribution, and office upkeep.

<h3>Duties</h3>
<p>Administrative services managers typically do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Supervise clerical and administrative staff</li>
<li>Set goals and deadlines for their department</li>
<li>Develop, manage, and monitor records</li>
<li>Recommend changes to policies or procedures in order to improve operations, such as reassessing supplies or recordkeeping</li>

<p>Specific tasks and responsibilities may vary. For example, an administrative services manager might be responsible for making sure that the organization has the supplies and services it needs. An administrative services manager who coordinates space allocation might consider employee morale and available funds when determining how to arrange a physical space.</p>
<p>Administrative services managers may examine energy consumption patterns, technology use, and office equipment. They also may plan for maintenance and replacement of equipment, such as computers.</p>
<p>The following are examples of types of administrative services managers:</p>
<p><strong><em>Facilities managers</em></strong> oversee buildings, grounds, equipment, and supplies. Their responsibilities cover several categories, including operations, maintenance, and planning and managing projects.</p>

<p>Adult literacy and high school equivalency diploma teachers who work in public schools must have at least a bachelor&rsquo;s degree and a license or certification.</p>
<h3><strong>Education</strong></h3>
<p>Adult literacy and high school equivalency diploma teachers in public schools must have at least a bachelor&rsquo;s degree. Some community colleges may prefer to hire those with a master&rsquo;s degree or graduate coursework in adult education or English as a Second Language (ESL).</p>
<p>Programs in adult education prepare prospective teachers to use effective strategies for adult learners, work with students from a variety of cultures and backgrounds, and teach adults with learning disabilities. Some programs allow these prospective teachers to specialize in adult basic education, secondary education, or ESL.</p>
<p>Prospective ESL teachers should take courses or training in linguistics and theories of how people learn second languages. Knowledge of a second language is not necessary to teach ESL, but it can be helpful.</p>
<p>Teacher education programs instruct prospective teachers in how to present information to students and how to work with students of varying abilities and backgrounds. Programs typically include an opportunity for student-teachers to work with a mentor and get experience in a classroom. For information about teacher preparation programs in your state, visit <a class=""external"" href=""https://www.teach.org/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Teach.org</a>.</p>
<p>Adult literacy and high school equivalency diploma teachers may take professional development classes to improve their teaching skills and ensure that they keep up with research about teaching adults.</p>
<h3><strong>Licenses, Certifications, and Registrations</strong></h3>
<p>Adult literacy and high school equivalency diploma teachers who work in public schools must have a teaching certificate. Some states have certificates specifically for adult education. Other states require teachers to have a certificate in elementary or secondary education.</p>
<p>To obtain a license, adult literacy and high school equivalency diploma teachers typically need a bachelor&rsquo;s degree and must complete a student-teaching program. For more information, contact the director of adult education for your state. Contact information is available from the <a class=""external"" href=""https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ovae/pi/AdultEd/index.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">U.S. Department of Education</a>.</p>
<h3><strong>Important Qualities</strong></h3>
<p><strong><em>Communication skills.</em></strong> Adult literacy and high school equivalency teachers must collaborate with other teachers and program administrators. In addition, they must explain concepts in terms that students can understand.</p>
<p><strong><em>Cultural sensitivity.</em></strong> Teachers work with students from a variety of cultural, educational, and economic backgrounds. They must be respectful of their students&rsquo; backgrounds and be understanding of their concerns.</p>
<p><strong><em>Patience.</em></strong> Working with students of different abilities and backgrounds can be difficult. Teachers must be patient when students struggle to understand the material.</p>
<p><strong><em>Resourcefulness.</em></strong> Teachers must be able to think on their feet and find ways to keep students engaged in learning. They may have to change their methods of instruction to address the different needs of their students. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Employment of adult literacy and high school equivalency diploma teachers is projected to decline&nbsp;10 percent from 2019 to 2029.</p>
<p>Enrollment in adult education and ESL programs has declined in recent years. At the same time, high school graduation rates have increased, reducing the number of adults seeking to obtain high school equivalent diplomas. As these trends continue, the demand for adult literacy and high school equivalency diploma teachers may decline.</p>
<p>Changes in government funding for adult education and ESL programs may impact the demand for adult literacy and high school equivalency diploma teachers.</p>
<h3><strong>Job Prospects</strong></h3>
<p>Many adult literacy and high school equivalency diploma teacher positions are part time. As a result, prospects will be best for workers who are willing and able to take a part-time position.

<p>Adult literacy and high school equivalency diploma teachers instruct adults in basic skills, such as reading, writing, and speaking English. They also help students earn their high school equivalent diploma.</p>
<h3><strong>Duties</strong></h3>
<p>Adult literacy and high school equivalency diploma teachers typically do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Plan and teach lessons to help students gain the knowledge and skills needed to earn their high school equivalent diploma</li>
<li>Adapt teaching methods based on students&rsquo; strengths and weaknesses</li>
<li>Emphasize skills that will help students find jobs, such as learning English words and common phrases used in the workplace</li>
<li>Assess students for learning disabilities</li>
<li>Monitor students&rsquo; progress</li>
<li>Help students develop study skills</li>
<li>Connect students to other resources in their community, such as job placement services</li>
</ul>
<p>Students&rsquo; educational level and skills are assessed before they enter these programs. Teachers may conduct the assessments; however, sometimes another staff member assesses students. Based on the results of the assessment and the student&rsquo;s goals, teachers develop an education plan.</p>
<p>Teachers must formally evaluate their students periodically to determine their progress and potential to go on to the next level of classes. However, teachers may informally evaluate their students&rsquo; progress continually.</p>
<p>Adult literacy and high school equivalency diploma teachers often have students of various education levels in their classes. As a result, these teachers need to use different strategies to meet the needs of all of their students. They may work with students in classes or teach them one-on-one.</p>
<p>There are three types of education that adult literacy and high school equivalency diploma teachers provide:</p>
<p><strong><em>Adult basic education (ABE)</em></strong> classes teach students the basics of reading, writing, and math. The students generally are age 16 or older and need to gain proficiency in these skills to improve their job situation. Teachers prepare students for further education and help them to develop skills that they will need in the workplace. For example, they may teach students how to write a resume.</p>
<p><strong><em>English as a Second Language (ESL),</em></strong> also called <em>English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL)</em>,<em> </em>classes teach students to read, write, and speak English. Students in these classes are immigrants to the United States or those whose native language is not English. ESL teachers may have students from many different countries and cultures in their classroom. Because the ESL teacher and the students may not share a common native language, ESL teachers must be creative with their communication in the classroom.</p>
<p>ESL teachers often focus on helping their students with practical vocabulary for jobs and daily living. They also may focus on preparing their students to take the citizenship exam.</p>
<p><strong><em>High school equivalency and adult secondary education</em></strong> classes prepare students to take the test to earn a high school equivalent diploma. Some programs are combined with career preparation programs so that students can earn a high school equivalent diploma and a career-related credential at the same time.</p>
<p>The high school equivalency exam is composed of four subjects: language arts, math, science, and social studies. In addition to teaching these subjects, teachers also help their students improve their skills in communicating, critical thinking, and problem solving&mdash;skills they will need in preparing for further education and successful careers.</p>
