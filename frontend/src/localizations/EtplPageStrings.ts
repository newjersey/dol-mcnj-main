    "The ETPL is intended to be an online report card that provides information on all providers and programs of occupational training in New Jersey. This website containing the ETPL and the CRC are available to everyone - not just those seeking training with public funds. Consequently, if you want your program information to be considered by those seeking training, your school and program information should be on the list to avoid being at a competitive disadvantage. If you are not on the list, those seeking training on this website will not find you and may come to the conclusion that you do not exist or are not approved. In addition, although your program may not receive state or federal training funds at this time, you may want to be eligible in the future.",
