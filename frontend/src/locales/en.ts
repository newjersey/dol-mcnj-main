We respect your personal privacy and want you to be familiar with how we collect, disclose, and otherwise use ("Process") your information. This Information Collection Statement describes our practices in connection with the information we collect through this Website. Please read the following to learn more about our privacy practices.

### Definition of Personal Information

For purposes of this Information Collection Statement, "Personal Information" means any information that can be used to distinguish or trace an individual’s identity, either alone or when combined with other personal or identifying information that is linked or linkable to a specific individual.

### What We Collect

The User Created Content that you voluntarily provide to us or post to the Website or use to access the Website, which may include personal information or training search-related information and documentation, including:

- Support inquiries (e.g., technical, training-related), feedback, and other communications
- Site-generated data, including recommendations provided to you
- Interactions with the Website and related metadata
- Information about the devices you use to access the site
- Website analytics data

This User Created Content will be used solely for the purposes of providing you the stated service on the Website, enabling us to monitor and improve the Website, and reporting aggregate data about the use of the Website.

We take reasonable steps to protect the information you provide us from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. We have implemented appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to help safeguard and secure your information. Unfortunately, no security system is 100% secure; thus, we cannot ensure the security of all information you provide to us via our services.

Under no circumstances shall any User Created Information, except for that which is publicly posted and visible to all, be sold, rented, given, or provided to any third party.

Other information we may collect about you:

- **Cookies:** Our services may use "cookies" and similar technologies (collectively, "Cookies"). Cookies are small text files that this website sends to your computer for record-keeping purposes and are stored on your computer’s hard drive. Cookies make web browsing easier by saving your preferences to improve your next visit to our website.
  - One of the purposes of cookies is to simplify the use of the website. A cookie may save a user’s login details, for example, so the user does not need to log in every time.
  - Cookies are also used for statistical purposes, to determine how the website is used.

- **Google Analytics:** We may use Google Analytics to help us better understand how visitors use this website.
  - The information generated by the Google Analytics cookie about your use of this website is transmitted to and stored by Google. If you do not want your activity on this website to be tracked by Google Analytics, you may opt out using this link: [http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en](http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en).

- **From Other Sources:** We may receive your personal information from other sources, such as public databases, social media platforms, people with whom you are connected on social media platforms, as well as from other third parties. For example, if you connect your social media account to your website account, certain personal information from your social media account will be shared with us, which may include personal information that is part of your public profile or your friends' public profiles.

- **Other Non-Personal Information:** In addition to any personal information or other information that you choose to provide to us on our services, we and our third-party service providers may use various technologies that automatically collect certain website usage information whenever you visit or interact with our services. This information may include browser type, operating system, pages visited, time, source of the request, and other similar information. We may use this information for various purposes, including enhancing or improving our services. We may also collect your IP address or another unique identifier for the device you use to access the Internet ("Device Identifier"). A Device Identifier is a number automatically assigned to your device, and we may identify your device by its Device Identifier. We may associate your Device Identifier or website usage information with the personal information you provide, but we will treat the combined information as personal information.

We use non-personal information in various ways, including analyzing site traffic, understanding user needs and trends, and improving our services. We may use your non-personal information alone or aggregate it with information from others. We may share your non-personal information with third parties to achieve these objectives, but aggregate information is anonymous and does not personally identify you. We may provide our analysis and certain non-personal information to third parties to provide additional services tailored to your needs, but this will not involve disclosing your personally identifiable information.

Because aggregated or anonymized information does not constitute personal information, we may use it for any purpose. If we combine anonymized or aggregated data with personal information, we will treat the combined information as personal information according to this Privacy Notice.

We may process personal information in connection with any of the following:

1. **Our business transactions with you**, including but not limited to:
   - Responding to your inquiries and fulfilling your requests
   - Sending administrative information to you, such as information regarding the services
   - Completing and fulfilling any requests for services

3. **With your consent**, when provided. In some cases, you have the right to decline to provide your consent, and if provided, to withdraw your consent at any time.

4. **For legal reasons**, including but not limited to:
   - Compliance with applicable law
   - Responding to legal processes
   - Responding to requests from public and government authorities, including those outside your state or country of residence

- **Message Boards:** We may make reviews, message boards, blogs, and other user-generated content available. Any information disclosed in these areas becomes public, and you should be careful when deciding to disclose your personal information. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of other users or websites.

- **Disclosure Permitted by Law:** We may disclose your personal information to law enforcement authorities, other government or public agencies, regulators, or other entities with appropriate legal authority if required or permitted by law to protect our rights, interests, privacy, property, or safety, and/or that of our affiliates, you, or other third parties.
