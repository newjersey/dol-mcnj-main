# 🚀 Quick Start - GitHub Actions Setup

## ✅ You're Ready to Go!

Your GitHub Actions workflow is **ready to use immediately** with **no secrets required** for basic CI testing.

---

## 📋 What's Already Configured

✅ **Environment Variables** - Set automatically in workflow:
- `IS_CI=true`
- `NODE_ENV=test`
- PostgreSQL connection (localhost, no password)

✅ **PostgreSQL Database** - Runs as service container

✅ **All CircleCI Features** - Fully replicated:
- Network diagnostics
- Retry logic with fallback registries
- Linting, security audits, unit tests
- Build and E2E tests with Cypress
- Coverage reports and artifacts

---

## 🎯 Next Steps

### 1. **Commit and Push** (Do this now!)
```bash
git add .github/
git commit -m "Add GitHub Actions CI pipeline from CircleCI"
git push
```

### 2. **Watch It Run**
- Go to: https://github.com/njdol-ori/dol-mcnj-main/actions
- Click on the latest workflow run
- Monitor both jobs: `node-tests` and `build-and-feature-tests`

### 3. **If You Need to Add CircleCI Environment Variables** (Optional - for later)
See: `.github/workflows/ENVIRONMENT-VARIABLES.md`

Most likely you only need to add secrets if:
- ❌ Tests fail due to missing AWS credentials (probably won't happen)
- ❌ Tests fail due to missing API keys (probably won't happen)
- ✅ You want to deploy from GitHub Actions (not needed for CI)

## 🐛 About `act` (Local Testing)

The error you saw is because Docker isn't running. To use `act`:

```bash
# Start Docker/Colima
colima start

# Run act with M-series architecture
act -j node-tests --container-architecture linux/amd64
```

**BUT** - you don't need `act`! Just push to GitHub and test there. It's faster and more reliable.

---

## 📊 Expected Results

### First Run Times
- **node-tests**: ~15-30 minutes
- **build-and-feature-tests**: ~30-45 minutes

### Artifacts You'll Get
- ✅ Next.js test coverage
- ✅ Backend test coverage (unit + integration)
- ✅ Cypress videos (always)
- ✅ Cypress screenshots (on failure)
- ✅ Feature test output logs

---

## 🎉 Why This Works Without Secrets

Your CircleCI configuration uses:
- Local PostgreSQL (no credentials needed)
- Test environment (no AWS services called)
- Empty database password

So the GitHub Actions workflow replicates this exactly! 🚀

## 🔥 Ready to Ship!

```bash
# One command to rule them all:
git add . && git commit -m "Add GitHub Actions CI from CircleCI" && git push
```

Then watch the magic happen in the Actions tab! ✨
