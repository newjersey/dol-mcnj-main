        copy: "## What is the Eligible Training Provider List (ETPL)?\n\nThe ETPL is a comprehensive list of training providers and training programs that the New Jersey Department of Labor & Workforce Development has determined eligible to receive publicly funded tuition assistance.\n\nThe ETPL is mandated by both State and Federal laws. New Jersey State Law (C:34:15C-10.2) states that \"[n]o training provider who is not an approved training provider included on the [ETPL] shall receive any federal job training funds or State job training funds.\"\n\nThe ETPL serves as a consumer protection for New Jersey's training seekers. New Jersey's ETPL is made available to NJ residents through the Training Explorer tool.\n\nTraining providers on the ETPL must submit their organizational and participant information to the ETPL through the IntelliGrants (IGX) system.\n\n## Benefits of being on the ETPL\n\n- Your organization's training program will be eligible for state or federal tuition funding.\n- Maximize public visibility and broaden your access to training seekers. This website is available to everyone - not just those seeking training with federal or State funds. If you are not listed on the ETPL, training seekers may conclude that your program does not exist or is not approved.\n- Showcase your training program's outcomes and return on investment.\n\n## How to join the ETPL\n\nTraining providers seeking ETPL placement must first obtain approval from a qualified government agency to offer training programs. A qualified government agency is authorized by law or regulation to approve a training program. For more information about what qualified government agency your organization falls under, [see our FAQ](https://mycareer.nj.gov/faq).\n\nNext, all training providers seeking placement on the NJ ETPL under Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) or NJ State law must submit a formal application to the NJDOL Center of Occupational Employment Information (COEI) on IGX-NJDOL's modernized ETPL application and reporting system [Intelligrants](https://njdol.intelligrants.com).\n\n## Reporting\n\nAll training providers listed on the ETPL must report and submit student enrollment and exit records every quarter through the IGX system. Quarterly reports are due on these dates:\n\n| **Reporting Dates** |\n|----------------------|\n| January 15th         |\n| April 15th           |\n| July 15th            |\n| October 15th         |\n\n## Maintaining your program on the ETPL\n\nAn organization needs to renew its ETPL eligibility every two years through the IGX system. Program additions or modifications can also be made through the IGX system.\n\n## In-Demand Occupations\n\nTo be eligible for some certain and federal funding, your training program must lead to employment in an in-demand occupation. The list of NJâ€™s In-Demand Occupations can be found [here](https://mycareer.nj.gov/in-demand-occupations).\n\nMore information about the In-demand Occupation List can be found on our [FAQ page](https://mycareer.nj.gov/faq#indemand-occupation-list).",

        copy: "## What is IGX?\n\nIntelligrants (IGX) is a new web portal for training providers to access, update, upload, and submit their information. Training Providers will also be able to make initial and renewal application payments and upload required documents online.\n\nThe ETPL listings managed through IGX are then displayed on the Training Explorer tool. IGX and Training Explorer are replacing The New Jersey Training Opportunities website (NJTOPPS).\n\nOther parts of NJDOL also use IGX to manage grants and contracts. IGX can be found at: [https://njdol.intelligrants.com](https://njdol.intelligrants.com).",

Ratings will be statistically adjusted to reflect the student population you are serving.\n- Poorly performing programs will be asked to develop corrective action plans to address their performance challenges and will be given two years to improve their ratings.",

        copy: "## Apprenticeships\n\nRegistered Apprenticeship programs must only be listed on the ETPL if they seek to receive state or federal job training funds. Otherwise, ETPL participation is optional.\n\nRegistered Apprenticeship programs are not subject to the same application requirements as all other training providers. Registered Apprenticeship program sponsors that request to be listed on the ETPL are automatically included on the list and will remain as long as the program is registered or until the program sponsor notifies the State that it no longer wants to be included on the list.\n\nCOEI shall work directly with the Office of Apprenticeship to semi-annually obtain a listing of all newly Registered Apprenticeship programs in New Jersey. Office of Apprenticeship shall contact all Registered Apprenticeship programs on the list to obtain the programs' interest in ETPL placement. Contacted Registered Apprenticeship programs who wish to be listed on the ETPL must submit the [Registered Apprenticeship Application](http://lwd.dol.state.nj.us/labor/forms_pdfs/coei/ETPL/ETPLRegisteredApprenticeshipApplicationPacket.pdf).\n\nAlthough WIOA does not require Registered Apprenticeship programs to submit program performance information in order to be placed on or remain eligible for ETPL placement, the submission of student information is required pursuant to New Jersey state law. Any Registered Apprenticeship program electing to be added to the ETPL must agree to and adhere to the student record reporting requirements as all other programs on the ETPL.\n\nCOEI will work directly with the Office of Apprenticeship to obtain a listing of all deregistered apprenticeship programs at least every two years. Any programs actively listed on the ETPL that are no longer registered with the Office of Apprenticeship will be removed from the ETPL.\n\nPre-apprenticeship programs do not have the same automatic ETPL status under WIOA as Registered Apprenticeship programs. They must follow the initial application process to obtain ETPL placement.\n\n## Out-of-State Schools\n\nAn out-of-state training provider that has been determined eligible under ETPL eligibility procedures in the provider's home state is considered eligible for ETPL placement in New Jersey. However, out-of-state eligible training providers must still submit an ETPL application to COEI and include proof of ETPL eligibility in the provider's home state.",
